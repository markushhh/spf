`spf` offers the possibility to download data from the [Survey of Professional Forecasters](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/survey-of-professional-forecasters/data-files) (SPF) provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. 

## Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("markushhh/spf")
```

```{r}
library("spf")
```

## Examples

```{r}
df <- get_mean("NGDP", type = "level")
tail(df)
```

```{r}
df <- get_individual("NGDP")
tail(df)
```

```{r df, out.width = "40%"}
library("ggplot2")
library("tsibble")

df %>%
  summarize_group(f = mean, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(YEARQUARTER, NGDP1), col = "steelblue")
```

```r
df <- get_mean("RGDP", type = "level")
df <- get_mean("RGDP", type = "growth")
df <- get_mean("RGDP", type = "pct")
df <- get_mean("EMP", type = "level")
df <- get_mean("EMP", type = "pct")
df <- get_mean("EMP", type = "ave")
df <- get_median("EMP", type = "level")
df <- get_median("EMP", type = "pct")
df <- get_median("EMP", type = "ave")
df <- get_dispersion("EMP")
df <- get_anxious_index()
df <- get_inflation()
df <- get_additional_cpie10()
get_microdata(file = "SPFmicrodata.xlsx") # download and writes "SPFmicrodata.xlsx" to the disk
get_prob(file = "prob.xlsx") # download and writes "prob.xlsx" to the disk
